# Brainster Projects, Boris Kuzmanovski - FE13

## Project 01 - Brainster Labs

## Description

For this project, the primary goal was to build a page which will host projects from the students of the Brainster academies for Marketing, Design and Coding. Also this project was an introduction to JavaScript, for the students.

## Steps Taken

To start off, I watched the video presentation that was provided to us about filtering the cards, which was very useful, and then I used it on my project. Then I read a lot of materials and examples about making a load more button and including pagination on mobile view, which was the most challenging part of the project. I also included form validation and coming soon page.
